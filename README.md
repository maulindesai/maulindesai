# About Me

I am a dedicated technology enthusiast with a strong interest in Linux. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in Kubernetes (k8s), Grafana, Loki, and Helm. This repository serves as a space to document my learning journey, projects, and resources related to these technologies.

I welcome collaboration and connections with fellow learners and professionals in the tech community.
